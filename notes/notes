remove or comment out _opCount lines from opforSpawner, to see if anything breaks
20sept I believe this is done

test with AIC and UAV running
20sept not done!
02oct done, works well, easier to see blu assets, it does throw an error from time to time

research cutRSC text and use to remove all systemchat and hints
20sept so done!

big test: does opforAltis.sqf work..?!
20sept yep!

separate script to check state if mission will enable HUD changes to PZ or LZ
highlighting which one is current automatically
20 sept sorted!

check counts so that fire teams of 4 do not go up aganst a team of 30..
if numbers are low, set state to MUSTER ... then tha team will not move in until blu 
numbers are x
20sept not done
02oct this is done. Units will now wait until 16 are ready to move in.

if enemy is 30, then you could have two teams of 8 move in. 
20 sept not done
02 oct not done. But currently random red LZs are created until 16 units are ready to 
attack, this works ok.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



partially done ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

change process
22 sept
Write a change process - if I change code, I need to comment this somewhere, and also
if I have notes about flow, or HUD codes, these need to be updated also.
02 Oct
My notes / comments are better, but still do not have a clear model for flow

make initial defenders challenging
02 oct initial seems fine now they have a technical
08 oct need to reinstate technical in init defenders

there should be a limiter rule for blufor RF
e.g. compare blufor and opfor in main AO.. only offer RF if opfor is greater than blufor
add UAV
20 sept limiter now implemented to 16 blufor 
08 oct still no system to control subsequent blufor RF

stand-around-syndrome
test a low number for assignAsCargo, to see if that is the root cause of 'standAroundSyndrome'
20sept so resolved!
02oct so, not 100% resolved, as I still get this when I have 6 units to pickup. 5 seems to work fine.

welcome dialog 
.. where to start, how many units (performance helper), damage or no damage?
20 sept not done, but I think this could have a training mode and game mode
02 oct basic welcome dialog done, its not great but might allow better future versions

Mission Progression (States, Rules etc)
decide how to stage progression ... time based or number based?
20 sept game mode being explored, but may need to add time to equasion also
02 oct no progress. I would like to have a config dialog on mission start.
here, player can see info about the mission, and set difficulty levels.
08 oct I now have 5 stages (deploy, attack, defend, support and extract)
more refinement is needed on this, and currently no extract rules!

create ambient FOB vehciles and troops, and delete when you are not near
20sept not done

create static fob (tents etc)
20sept not done
08 oct - FOB is now created, but is static for the mission 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



to do ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Score System
how to keep score of KDR? linked to CUTRSC
20 sept not done
02 oct no counter still
08 oct nope

Dynamic (flashing) Markers
20sept not done
02oct no progress

count passengers when in air, and check assigned spaces with no. of passengres
if no passengers, but assigned places, unassign places
20 sept not done
02 oct no progress
08 oct nope

need some flares!!
20 sept not done
02 oct no progress
08 oct nope

by having different unit gen scripts, you can use switch to allow user to choose 
flavour of blu and opfor units
20 sept not done
02 oct still not done, can be a config item?
08 oct nope

ATTATCHTO - GPMG TO MH6 BENCHES
20 sept not done

08 oct nope

setcaptive player if flying under x ..
i.e. if you can get to BZ under x atl, you can surpsrise the enemy
this will help when more advanced armoured vics arrive on-scene 

easy arty .. can your look pos show the map coords? If so, you look, and call 
in arty with no dialog box

can i count ferried units and track how many are alive when I leave?

when dropping off units, create a temp marker around player, so that instead of 
moving all units in BZ, you only affect a small group around the player heli

02oct 
new display for timer 
set fuel to always on
create new fuel countdown timer
set fuel of off when timer runs out

have ability to 'mark' a location using voice, and show in HUD.. 
keydown = getPos showPos .. use POS for arty?

make it so that the LAND NOW message appears ALWAYS while over LZ, and removes when not over LZ... make it easier for players to know the LZ without smoke



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------























------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
draft mission logic

original idea
mission starts ... you pick up 4, you deploy them at a good LZ. 
You then need to get another 4, and bring to the same LZ.
8 at LZ 1. 
Next pick up another 4, and choose another LZ, and as before, 
they wait until another 4 is added.
When 16 are on ground, they move in automatically...
your job is to scout the outer AO for good LZ locations.

02oct update
Deployment:
You pick up teams of 5 at PZs close to the area of operations
Units will board automatically when you land
PZs are marked with red smoke
On pickup, you'll be given an LZ location to deploy the team
Be aware, there is some limited 50cal on the ground, so stay low where you can
If a tech spots you, it will close in, so keep your speed up also

Attack:
Once you have enough units on the ground, they move in to attack the objective 
automatically
When Attack is in progress, reinforcements are more limited, 2 per pickup and 
further out (for balance)
However, when attack is in progress you can deploy these pairs anywhere in the 
main AO (blue zone)

Defend:
If the attack team removes the opfor defenders, they take up defensive positions 
and prepare to repell opfor RF
Opfor RF currently runs on a loop, so you'll need to work hard to keep the in-field 
objective supplied with fresh units
q - can I automate the collection of dead blu units for extraction?
During this stage, there may be armour incoming, so ensure there are adequate AT 
assets in-field. 
Watch your approaches also.

Extract:
Once you have held the location for 30 minutes, it is time to extract. You are 
required to remove all live blufor units
extraction will be in groups, and during this phase, BF will automatically group 
in flat areas for extraction on blue smoke
Currently, during extraction, no opfor will attack, but this can be changed of course.


mission start

state: phase1 = true

task:
no blufor in BZ = no marker for LZ ... you can choose anywhere in the region 
go and pickup 4 units, drop them anywhere in BZ.. once away phase1 = false


if phase1 = false (ie completed) then phase2 = true

task:
once <= 4 blfor on ground in BZ = set LZ marker as your current landing pos, go and 
get 4 more and bring back to this new LZ
once delivered, once away phase 2 = false (completed)

now you have 8 units holding at the edge of the BZ

(notes: while this is going on, numbers are updated in HUD, but also add their holding 
state = holding or move in)

once phase 2 = false, then phase 3 = true 

if phase 3 = true, then mission is to pick up 4 new units, and deploy them anywhere in 
the BZ 
This can be the same location as before, or different 
once deployed phase 3 = false and phsae 4 = true ..

if phase 4 = true, then go and pick up final 4 units, and bring them back to the phase 
3 LZ 
once last 4 deployed, then phase 4 = false 

if phase 4 = false, then attack = true 
if attack = true, then all blufor units set behaviour to combat and move in simultaneously 
drectly to core obj. 

note - can the core obj we want to take be a point of interest? 

if opfor units are <= 2, then attack = false and defend = true 
if defend = true, then all blufor go 360 dfence 





if defend = true, then send in opfor RF

if defend = true and opfor <= 2 then success = true 
if success = true then show well done image 
then you need to move all remaining units to the next BZ x km away and start this all again.
if defend = true and blufor = 0 then mission ends with failure message
fade to black with text that uses player name and mission location in the text narritive

additional idea .. if defend = true and blufor <= 6 then you can extract them by flying 
and landing near them.. they will jump in for escape..
6 means that there could be a final extraction of 1 or 2 units ... 
if that happens ... medal screen :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------















once initial attack force of 16 has been deployed, a trigger is set so that a new RF mission is created immediately
so you can stock up on 4 new units as the attack starts. once mission state ATTACK = TRUE then you can drop RF anywhere in the BZ and they will move in
but, the RF limit is then set ... if BZ blufor >= 20, no more opfor RF allowed until blufor numbers are <= 16.. cycle this every 30 seconds ... once blufor numbers 
i can do this now..
every second check blufor in BZ .. if <= then create PZ mission. if > 16, do nothing.
AND in mission intel, have line to say "Reinforcements avaiable" or "no rf currently in area".




once all units on ground what can you do?
you can fly and drop yellow smoke. the playerpos atpoint of drop = arty.sqf
create some random HE hits on the area.
state availability in mission intel "artillery strike availbale"



20sept
made a start on this
now the mission creates a specific LZ and triggers alerts when you are near
it also limits blufor to 16, so if 16 are alive, no more should be created
I guess as soon as one dies, more will be available..
I removed debugging cutRsc messages

add time (mission time)

add 10 digit location
20 sept DONE


21sept
need a line of instructions at base of screen
mission state
current instruction

land now is a small addition! not a message!
HAVE DIST TO EDGE OF LANDING ZONE UNDERNEATH TO SHOW HOW MUCH SPACE LEFT TO LAND


create dialog to allow player to specify size of mission area.
Always have PZ as within outer edge of BZ
so PZ - BZ radius - 80 or something

Spend time thinking about how a training mssion would compare to a real mission
so, unlimited health, unlimted units, etc

build a flow so that when state is ATTACK, and new units are created, in that event you can land anywhere in BZ





23sept
tested last night, and the mission was very enjoyable.
having AT to bring in assed a new element to the gameplay.. it was OP however
next time, try one AT at a time.
Also, i gen'd 6 per PZ, but only 5 only ever got on . always one waited behind. 
So, try with 1 AT, this may just fix the issue.

Base = gen + AT pickup

I need to create a DEFEND state..

Once DEFEND, then you should be able to drop off units anywhere in the BZ, and they will move in. That way, you can position them befind theenemy and they will
attack enemy from behind.

I need to mark how many vehicles are in the BZ, in the HUD
I need to limt PZ creations .. 
I need to create small zones so that when you land at your base, you can land near x y or z and different uits jump abourd.

so if land next to basePZ1 you get 1 or 2 AT, basePZ2 = medics, basePZ3 = FR, PZ4 = HMGs 

so the flow seems to be:

Deployment
visit local PZs, and bring 4 teams into position around the target

Attack
when they move in, you can continue to pick up as normal, but can deploy anywhere in the BZ 
(limits apply)

Defend
when defending you job is to extract any injured, and bring back in (from your base) any additional troops
When bringing in new units, they can be deployed anywhere in the BZ, either at Core, or on outskirts

todo - make so that if I land within 25m of units, the 6 nearest jump aboard. This way, I can take units at Core and pos them elsewhere
todo - create a score system to track how many units have been created for the mission - this is the mission cost.
So, track both units created as well as units lost. Also count units extracted and brought back to base..

todo - decide how to progress the mission.
So, deployment ok, attack ok, and defend against a single column ok. when all units removed, what then?
I think we create a new core somewhere else.. however befre BAU PZ rules apply, you need to extract all injured to BAse
You then have to use all remaining uits at first core.

todo - create new box at bottom of screen to track opfor numbers and their status - defend, attack. 

todo, cn I have a high level map view, that can be toggles on/off that is always BHOT that can show the BZ?

        send those units to a location
        instruct player to extract via HUD

Objective 2: Manage passengers 
tasks:  ID all current passengers on heli 
        show this in HUD

what is a variable?for

bunnykins = 7; 
sammy = 7; 
bunnykins + sammy = 14;

what is an array? is simply a list.

    0       1        2      3       4   




int, float, bool?
// int = a whole number
// float = a number with a decimal point, like 6.3, 14.88. 0.88338
// bool = true or false (bool is short for boolean)

CONFIG DIALOG

what player options?

Do you want invunerabiity turned on or off?

When deploying troops before the main attack, do you want to select LZs, or be given them by central command?
This would need a new message. I.e. if you can deploy anywhere then tell pilot "better choose a good position"

Do you want to have opfor RF always arrive as one group, two, three? Do you want attacks to be random or in a group?
If a group, do you want always one group, always two, always three, escalate from one to three or random?

How many waves before area is secured?

Dialog plan, two choices: damage on/off? and: deploy anywhere, or at set LZs?
