Welcome to RDS - Rapid Deployment Simulator

The aim of this mission is to provide a system to improve:

    * map reading
        *heading familiarity
    * general piloting
        *landing
        *takeoffs
        *NAP

Mission is broken down into key stages:

    * Deploy 
        * pickup and then dropoff fire teams at key locations around the main objective
    * Attack
        * when enough units are on the ground, they will attack the objective automatically
    * Defend
        * when units have taken objective, they dig in and prepare to repell more opfor attackers
    * Support
        * when opfor are attacking your job is then to keep the flow of units on the battlefield vai heli-drop 
    * Extract
        * when all opfor waves have been repelled, you are to extract all remaining units, back to the FOB

Deploy State
Here you essentially follow the HUD instructions. You have a PZ and an LZ guidance system, that will show you both
direction and distance to your next objective. Your actual objective (Pick up or drop off) will be marked by a white
bar in the HUD, above the relevant marker. You will pick up and drop off appx 20 units, deploying them an the red 
map markers. While the HUD can guide your progress without any map interaction, having GPS on-screen can be very helpful.
Once all units have been deployed, they move to Attack State.

Attack State
Currently there are no tasks during this state, and you are to await successful (or otherwise) results in taking the
objective from initial defence forces. Once the objective has been taken, you move into Defend State.

Defend State
During this part of the mission, you are to pick up and then deploy at the core objective a team of AT Specialists. 
These units are needed to repell the incoming enemy armour. Again, the HUD will guide you to both the pickup and the LZ.

Support State
Once AT have been deployed, the enemy will begin their attack. Now you are able to pick up small units from the 
outskirts of the main battle area. As before, the HUD will guide you to their pickup location, however you are now able
to deploy them at any location within the marked battle area. It is suggested to place them in flanking positions to
engage attacking forces. This constitutes the main battle event, and will run for three increasingly difficult enemy
attacks. After three attacks have been (hopefuly) successfully repelled, you move into Extract State.

Extract State
now your task is simply to exfil any remaining units to the nearest FOB. There may be additional attacks inbound, so 
speed will be relevant here. Simply fly to the Core Objective, land, and units will board automatically. Once onboard,
deploy them at the FOB/Med-Base, and repeat the process until all friendlies are safely extracted. 

Mission Duration (for all above states) is appx 45 minutes.

I hope you enjoy the experience!

Cheers
